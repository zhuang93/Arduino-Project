This project mainly focuses on applying Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on Arduino. Basic knowledge about DWT can be found in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform).

Firstly, the one-level of the transform framework is shown in the Figure 1.

The expressions are shown below.
